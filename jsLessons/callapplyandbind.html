       conclusion
       in order to understand which object is the method is referring to,
       we need to understand the concept of implicit binding,
       in case of printPlayerName() which is available as a standalone method 
       as well as an object. In order to pinpoint the reference of that specific
       method , we need to look at the left side of it
