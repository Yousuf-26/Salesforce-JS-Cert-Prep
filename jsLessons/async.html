        /*
        Notes
        Asynchronous code is represented by setTimeOut() -- which is provided by web api
        Synchronous code is represented by while() -- which is a js code
        Asynchronous code is always executed after, all the syncrhonous code is completed
        Asynchronous code always moved from the call stack and send to the callback queue
